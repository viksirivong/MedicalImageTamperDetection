## Purpose

Today, a CT (Computed Tomography) scanner is an essential tool in health-care systems. CT scans are used to diagnose certain diseases (e.g., heart disease, trauma, infectious diseases, cancer, etc.) In 2020, health-care systems were attacked brutally leading to treatment interruptions and medical record breaches. Concerning the influential aspects of medical data, we will have to focus on inproving the security of health-care systems. In this research, we use a deep learning machine learning algorithm to detect tampered medical images.
